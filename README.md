# IoT-Based-Smart-Irrigation-
Explore this Repository to get the Proactive Knowledge on What the IoT Devices are and how they work. 
- > ### IoT Devices used for this project.
- There are three IoT devices used for this project they are as follows:
> Watering Plant pump
> Fan Actuator
> Water Pump Actuator.

- >  ### Working methodology of IoT Devices
- They work based on climatic conditions like temperature, Humidity, and Water level.
  
####  We aim to Predict the Working Of the Water Pump Actuator action (ON/OFF) based on the other discussed Factors above.

### Standard of Procedure to Build the Machine Learning Project 
we are going to follow the Steps :
- > Data acquired from the source
- > Data loading
- > Exploratory Data Analysis
- > Data Cleansing
- > Data Visualizations
- > Model Building
- > Evolution and performance 
- > Testing the Model 
- > saving the Model into a pickle or joblib file.
These are the Steps to be followed for fixing the Model for Deployment.
